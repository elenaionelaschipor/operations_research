    "# 8. The Traveling Student Problem\n",
    "In this lab session, you have to model and solve the **Traveling Student Problem (TSP)** by using **Integer Linear Programming**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TSP problem is defined as follows. You are given a set of $n$ university residences where a *matricola* (freshman) must go to sell the tickets for her/his college spring-party. The position of each residence is given by the geographic coordinates: in this exercise, the coordinates are points in an Euclidean plane. The distance $d_{ij}$ between any pair of residence is equal to the Euclidean distance between the corresponding pair of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TSP problem is to find the shortest cycle among all the residences (starting from the student residence and ending in the same residence) that minimizes the overall travelled distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** For a more formal definition of the **Travelling Salesman Problem** see the course slides, or visit [Bill's Cook homepage for Concorde](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html). Or, even better, you can look at this two lectures:\n",

    "1. A function `BuildDiGraph` to compute the distance between a pair of points, return a distance matrix.\n",
